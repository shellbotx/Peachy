Welcome to the peachy framework!
.. pull-quote ::
    Peachy is a game developement framework for building 2D games with Python.

Welcome to Peachy! This is the documentation for Peachy 0.1

Getting Started
    - :ref:`install`
    - :ref:`getting_started <First Steps>`
    - :ref:`tutorial`


You can also skip all that and check out the :ref:`api` directly.

Peachy uses Pygame (for now) and is not documented here, so it might be a good
idea to check out the basics of pygame:
