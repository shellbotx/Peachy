Peachy

Peachy is a framework you can use to make 2d games in Python. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Linux, and possibly OSX (untested).

Peachy is made up of the following modules:

* peachy - The core modules that contains the Engine, World, and Entity classes among others
* peachy.audio - Contains sound classes (still under heavy maintenance)
* peachy.fs - Short for 'filesystem', this module is used for loading and storing resources
* peachy.graphics - Responsible for rendering logic and animation
* peachy.stage - Used to load popular level editor templates
    * Only supports tiled, but planning to add OGMO and more generic methods
* peachy.ui - Generic user interface template
* peachy.utils - Utility functions for camera, user input handling, etc
