ZEN
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

RELEASE_NOTE
    Today I'm releasing Peachy. A python3 2D game framework.

    Features
        Simple architecture
            Get your program up and running in a few lines. Create unique Worlds, Rooms, and Entities in a few more.
        CLI utility
            Project scaffolding
            Profiling
            Building Executable
        Tiled support
            Load tiled maps and render them without the boilerplate
        Resource management
            Load, Store, and Categorize your resources.

    Peachy was modeled after FlashPunk and Love2D.

    Anyways, please give it a look over here, pull requests encouraged!


Can peachy be used without worrying about the inner implementation of functions?
If not, do better design
